My name is Sulaiman. I study web development at Aptech and work as a graphic designer. I have a strong
 interest in technology and design, and I enjoy building cutting-edge, aesthetically pleasing, and 
 intuitive websites. In order to be more creative, I also like to read articles and create logos. As a
  matric student, I'm putting a lot of effort into laying a solid foundation for my future in development and design.
  My goal is to become a skilled full-stack developer and professional designer.
I’m always eager to learn new tools and improve my creative and coding skills.
